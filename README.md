    Project 2: "Words in Motion" is a piece that allows me to share works that illustrate the meaning of community to me.
 # SongSelection 
    For this project, I selected two of my favorite songs that embody the spirit of community.
    "I Just Called to Say I Love You" by Stevie Wonder
    "Where Peaceful Waters Flow" by Gladys Knight & the Pips.
