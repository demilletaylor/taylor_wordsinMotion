            No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
            No first of spring, no song to sing
            In fact, here's just another ordinary day</h3>

            That leads us to who knows where, who knows where
            But I'm strong
            Strong enough to carry him
            He ain't heavy, he's my brother
            … So on we go
            His welfare is of my concern
            No burden is he to bear
            We'll get there
            … For I know
            He would not encumber me
            He ain't heavy, he's my brother</h3>

    <h3>If loneliness surrounds you
      And rain clouds always hang around you
      And wakin' up each day gets you down
      (Gets you down, gets you down)
      And if the life that you're leading
      Seems hollow then maybe
      What you're needing
      Is someone to turn your world around?
      Take my hand and walk with me
      Let me teach you how to smile
      And I'll show you skies where gentle breezes blow
      And I'll take you where peaceful waters flow
      (Peaceful waters flow)</h3>
